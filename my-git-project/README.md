Conclusion
To make a new git repository out of a directory –– which we'll only have to do once per project –– use git init. Be careful about making an entire directory, like our home directory or our desktop, into a git repository accidentally. Make sure you only type git init within the directory you want git to track. Whenever you make a change to a file or create a new file, you can check the status of these changes with git status. When you're ready to keep track of changes, you can add them individually with the git add <filename or path> command, or collectively with the git add . command. Once your changes have been added, use git commit -m

If we've followed these instructions, our my-git-project directory is now a git repository. We can retain the directory as a sandbox for Git experimentation, or delete or ignore it.
